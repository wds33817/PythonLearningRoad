We tested your code with file_1 = "file_1_copy.txt", file_2 = "file_3_copy.txt". We expected check_plagiarism to return the str "i left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time", and it did.

We tested your code with file_1 = "file_2_copy.txt", file_2 = "file_3_copy.txt". We expected check_plagiarism to return the bool False, and it did.

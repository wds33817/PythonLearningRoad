The following things were correct about your submission:

We expected to find a function named check_plagiarism in your code, and we did.

We tested your code with file_1 = "file_1_copy.txt", file_2 = "file_2_copy.txt". We expected check_plagiarism to return the str "if i go crazy then", and it did.

We tested your code with file_1 = "file_1_copy.txt", file_2 = "file_3_copy.txt". We expected check_plagiarism to return the str "i left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time", and it did.

We tested your code with file_1 = "file_2_copy.txt", file_2 = "file_3_copy.txt". We expected check_plagiarism to return the bool False, and it did.

We tested your code with file_1 = "file_pigkGm.txt", file_2 = "file_MwQiDh.txt". We expected check_plagiarism to return the str "moonlit conn band collinear language mardi indy whoa boatman", and it did.

We tested your code with file_1 = "file_pigkGm.txt", file_2 = "file_tTZVqw.txt". We expected check_plagiarism to return the str "occurred halve friction aint florist parapsychology chafe stanley transport doorkeep stern audiovisual fogarty storyboard heuristic fillip thrombosis windsor moliere bertie", and it did.

We tested your code with file_1 = "file_MwQiDh.txt", file_2 = "file_tTZVqw.txt". We expected check_plagiarism to return the bool False, and it did.

The contents of file_1_copy.txt, file_2_copy.txt, and file_3_copy.txt are the same as they were originally in your workspace. The contents of file_pigkGm.txt, file_MwQiDh.txt, and file_tTZVqw.txt are shown below:

#A common problem in academic settings is plagiarism
#detection. Fortunately, software can make this pretty easy!
#
#In this problem, you'll be given two files with text in
#them. Write a function called check_plagiarism with two
#parameters, each representing a filename. The function
#should find if there are any instances of 5 or more
#consecutive words appearing in both files. If there are,
#return the longest such string of words (in terms of number
#of words, not length of the string). If there are not,
#return the boolean False.
#
#For simplicity, the files will be lower-case text and spaces
#only: there will be no punctuation, upper-case text, or
#line breaks.
#
#We've given you three files to experiment with. file_1.txt
#and file_2.txt share a series of 5 words: we would expect
#check_plagiarism("file_1.txt", "file_2.txt") to return the
#string "if i go crazy then". file_1.txt and file_3.txt
#share two series of 5 words, and one series of 11 words:
#we would expect check_plagiarism("file_1.txt", "file_3.txt")
#to return the string "i left my body lying somewhere in the
#sands of time". file_2.txt and file_3.txt do not share any
#text, so we would expect check_plagiarism("file_2.txt",
#"file_3.txt") to return the boolean False.
#
#Be careful: there are a lot of ways to do this problem, but
#some would be massively time- or memory-intensive. If you
#get a MemoryError, it means that your solution requires
#storing too much in memory for the code to ever run to
#completion. If you get a message that says "KILLED", it
#means your solution takes too long to run.

#In this problem, we're going to explore a little of how
#game AI works. We'll do this with a simple problem: building
#an agent to play the popular card game Blackjack.
#
#Blackjack is a card game played with a standard 52-card
#deck. Suits do not matter in Blackjack, and so we'll just
#use letters to indicate the different cards: A, 2, 3, 4, 5,
#6, 7, 8, 9, 0 (for 10), J, Q, K. Note that the number 10 is
#represented by the single character 0.
#
#The goal of Blackjack is to get as close to 21 points as
#possible without going higher. Each of the thirteen cards
#above has a point total attached: the numerals are worth
#their given value (2 points for 2, 7 points for 7, etc.).
#J, Q, and K are worth 10 points. A is worth either 1 or 11
#points, whichever is better for the player.
#
#At any time, the player has some number of cards in their
#hand. They must then make a decision of whether to Hit or
#Stay. Hit means they request an additional card, Stay means
#they stop with their current total. Players generally try
#to Hit until it is likely that another card will push them
#over 21. For example, if a player has a 5 and a 7, there is
#a relatively low chance that another card would push them
#over 21 (only J, Q, and K would do so, since 12 + 10 = 22).
#On the other hand, if they have a 5, a 6, and a 7, they will
#likely stay because any card above 3 will push them over 21
#points.
#
#The specific goal in Blackjack is to get closer to 21 than
#the dealer. Dealers must follow a set of prescribed rules
#for when to Hit and Stay. These are the rules we'll use for
#our Blackjack-playing AI.
#
#The rules are:
#
# - The dealer must Hit if their total is below 17.
# - The dealer must Stay as soon as their total is 17 or
#   higher.
# - An Ace (A) should be counted as 11 if it puts the
#   dealer between 17 and 21 points. If it puts them over
#   21, though, it should be counted as 1.
#
#For example, imagine the dealer's first cards are A and 3.
#Their point total is either 4 or 14, both below 17, so they
#Hit. The next card is a 9. If we count the A as 11, then
#their total is now 23 (11 + 3 + 9), and so we count the
#A as 1. Their total is 13, and so they Hit again. The next
#card is a 7, so their total is 20, so they Stay.
#
#Write a function called next_move. next_move should have
#one parameter, a string. Each character of the string will
#be a card in the dealer's current hand, such as "AK" or
#"175". The function should return one of three strings:
#
# - "Hit" if the dealer should take another card.
# - "Stay" if the dealer should not take another card.
# - "Bust" if the sum is already over 21.
#
#Remember, your function is only responsible for playing
#one move at a time. Take in a string representing the
#current hand, return "Hit", "Stay", or "Bust".


#Add your code here!
def next_move(hand):
    total = 0
    ace_count = 0
    for card in hand:
        if card in "123456789":
            total += int(card)
        elif card in "JQK":
            total += 10
        elif card == "A":
            ace_count += 1
        else:
            total += 10
    print(total)
    if total > 21:
        return "Bust"
    
    if total >= 17:
        return "Stay"
    
    if ace_count > 0 and 17 <= total + 11 <= 21:
        return "Stay"
    
    return "Hit"

#Earlier in the course, you implemented a function that could
#find if someone had won a particular game of either tic-tac-
#toe or mancala based on a 2D list or tuple representing the
#current game board.
#
#In this problem, you'll do the same thing, but for the game
#Connect 4. Write a function called check_winner which takes
#as input a 2D list. It should return "X" if there are four
#adjacent "X" values anywhere in the list (row, column,
#diagonal); "O" if there are four adjacent "O" values
#anywhere in the list; and None if there are neither.
#
#Here are the ways Connect-4 is different from tic-tac-toe:
#
# - Connect-4 is played with 6 rows and 7 columns, not 3
#   rows and 3 columns.
# - You must have 4 in a row (or column or diagonal) to win
#   instead of 3.
# - You may only place pieces in the bottom-most empty
#   space in a column (e.g. you "drop" the pieces in the
#   column and they fall to the first empty spot). Note,
#   though, that this shouldn't affect your reasoning.
#
#To keep things simple, we'll still use "X" and "O" to
#represent the players, and None to represent empty spots.
#You may assume there will be only one winner per board,
#no characters besides "X", "O", and None, and you don't
#have to worry about whether the board is actually a
#valid game of Connect 4.
#
#Hints:
# - Don't forget both kinds of diagonals, top-left to
#   bottom-right and bottom-left to top-right.
# - This board is too large to check every possible place
#   for a winner: there are 69 places a player could win.
# - Remember, if you put a negative index in a list,
#   Python "wraps around" and checks the last value. You
#   may have to control for this.

#Let's try out a sort of data analysis-style problem. In
#this problem, you're going to have access to a data set
#covering Georgia Tech's all-time football history. The data
#will be a CSV file, meaning that each line will be a comma-
#separated list of values. Each line will describe one game.
#The columns, from left-to-right, are:
#
# - Date: the date of the game, in Year-Month-Day format.
# - Opponent: the name of the opposing team
# - Location: Home, Away, or Neutral
# - Points For: Points scored by Georgia Tech
# - Points Against: Points scored by the opponent
#
#If Points For is greater than Points Against, then Georgia
#Tech won the game. If Points For is less than Points Against,
#then Georgia Tech lost the game. If the two are equal, then
#the game was a tie.
#
#You can see a subsection of this dataset in season2016.csv
#in the top left, but the actual dataset you'll be accessing
#here will have 1237 games.
#
#Write a function called all_time_record. all_time_record
#should take as input a string representing an opposing team
#name. It should return a string representing the all-time
#record between Georgia Tech and that opponent, in the form
#Wins-Losses-Ties. For example, Georgia Tech has beaten
#Clemson 51 times, lost 28 times, and tied 2 times. So,
#all_time_record("Clemson") would return the string "51-28-2".
#
#We have gone ahead and started the function and opened the
#file for you. The first line of the file are headers:
#Date,Opponent,Location,Points For,Points Against. After that,
#every line is a game.

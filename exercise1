mystery_int = 5

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#This is a tough one! Stick with it, you can do it!
#
#Write a program that will print the times table for the
#value given by mystery_int. The times table should print a
#two-column table of the products of every combination of
#two numbers from 1 through mystery_int. Separate consecutive
#numbers with either spaces or tabs, whichever you prefer.
#
#For example, if mystery_int is 5, this could print:
#
#1	2	3	4	5
#2	4	6	8	10
#3	6	9	12	15
#4	8	12	16	20
#5	10	15	20	25
#
#To do this, you'll want to use two nested for loops; the
#first one will print rows, and the second will print columns
#within each row.
#
#Hint: How can you print the numbers across the row without
#starting a new line each time? With what you know now, you
#could build the string for the row, but only print it once
#you've finished the row. There are other ways, but that's
#how to do it using only what we've covered so far.
#
#Hint 2: To insert a tab into a string, use the character
#sequence "\t". For example, "1\t2" will print as "1	2".
#
#Hint 3: Need to just start a new line without printing
#anything else? Just call print() with no arguments in the
#parentheses.
#
#Hint 4: If you're stuck, try first just printing out all
#the products in one flat list, each on its own line. Once
#that's working, then worry about how to organize it into
#a table.


#Add your code here!
for i in range(1, mystery_int + 1):
    row = ""
    for j in range(1, mystery_int + 1):
        row += str(i * j) + "\t"
    print(row)








mystery_string = "Lucy"

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#There's an easy way to do this exercise, and a hard way. For
#a hint on the easier way, revisit the sample answers for the
#previous coding exercise.
#
#Above we've created a variable called mystery_string. Write
#some code that will print the first letter of the string on
#the first line, the first two letters on the second line,
#the first three letters on the third line, etc., until it
#prints the entire string on the last line.
#
#For example, if the string was "Lucy", then the output would
#be:
#
#L
#Lu
#Luc
#Lucy
#
#Hint: to print without automatically starting a new line,
#include the text end="" inside the print statement's
#parentheses. For example, print("Hello", end="") will print
#the word "Hello" without starting a new line afterward. So,
#calling it twice would print "HelloHello" on one line
#instead of two lines.


#Add your code here!
for i in range(1, len(mystery_string)+1):
    print(mystery_string[:i])
